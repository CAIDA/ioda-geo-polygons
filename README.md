CAIDA IODA Polygons
-------------------

This directory contains the sub-national (regional) polygon dataset created as
part of CAIDA's
[Internet Outages Detection and Analysis (IODA) project](https://ioda.caida.org).

The primary dataset is found at:
[geojson/ne_10m_admin_1.regions.v3.0.0.processed.geo.json.gz](geojson/ne_10m_admin_1.regions.v3.0.0.processed.geo.json.gz)
which is a GeoJSON-formatted set of regional polygons.  Each polygon has (at
least) `id`, `fqid`, `name`, and `usercode` fields.
